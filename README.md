1. Check that you are  on the master branch, and then `git pull origin master` to ensure you have the freshest copy. 
2. If you are adding a new feature or making a new change, `git checkout -b firstname-name_of_change` . (if you want to access a pre existing branch, omit the b. If you want to access one of my branches, `git checkout origin my_branch_name` - if that fails omit the origin)
3. Make the change in the code 
4. Ensure everything works, in this case, check the website on your machine. The filesystem should have the most recent version/branch you are working on so nothing to worry about there. (Though I have had editors whose internal file systems need to be closed and re opened to reflect changes.)
5. `git add filename`
6. `git commit -m “description of change"`
7. `git push origin branch_name`
8. Go to github repository website (or maybe atom lets you do this), and click the ‘make pull request’ tab. Do that with your new branch. Assign someone (me) as a reviewer (and I will do the same for you), to ensure the changes are working, as well as desirable
