<div id="mission-statement"><p> <span class="title">(An)other//worldly energies</span><span class = "body"> sets out to explore the enactment of more-than-human relationality and care. We respond to the twin pandemics of coronavirus and state violence with an imaginative practice of engineering and iterating other worlds, anchored by a commitment to environmental, racial, and economic justice. Calling on all that which persists at the limits of sensibility—the haunted & enchanted, the synthetic & organic, the astral & ancestral, the impure & inhospitable, the vegetal & mineral, the enfleshed & unembodied, the mythical & maternal—we counter the imperatives of settler colonialism and late capitalist meltdown by opening portals for the otherworldly to break into our own.</span></p></div></body>
